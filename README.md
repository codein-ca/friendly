# App: Friendly

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.7.

## Main modules as I see it now

The app has a whole bunch of features, but in other to save some time the main API are:
- This will speed up the tests with profiles of fake users for illustrative purposes - https://randomuser.me/
- This will speed up the retrieval of login information to actually display custom user data - https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/web

Finally a more advanced feature would be to enable communication with nearby users:
- To check users that are nearby, a google maps feature is required - https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/start
- To allow users to communicate with each other using our platform, I am not sure but I guess Node is required - https://socket.io/get-started/chat/
