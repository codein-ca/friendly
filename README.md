# Friendly "I am here"

A react project. Monorepo with Lerna. BE with Node.

## TODO
- Switch to latest React
- Get started with TDD in mind

## Main modules as I see it now

The app has a whole bunch of features, but in other to save some time the main API are:
- This will speed up the tests with profiles of fake users for illustrative purposes - https://randomuser.me/
- This will speed up the retrieval of login information to actually display custom user data - https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/web
- Taking a photo with the browser - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Taking_still_photos

Finally a more advanced feature would be to enable communication with nearby users:
- To check users that are nearby, a google maps feature is required - https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/start
- To allow users to communicate with each other using our platform, I am not sure but I guess Node is required - https://socket.io/get-started/chat/
